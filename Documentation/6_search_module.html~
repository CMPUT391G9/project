<h2>6.2 Search Result</h2>
<p>The search module, upon receiving the search condition, will display a list of all radiology records that satisfy the search condition, and are accessible to the user by the security module.</p>
<p>The search results are printed in a table. Each record displayed shall contain all the information, including the list of thumbnails of medical images, of the record. The specified medical image will be displayed in the browser upon an image thumbnail is clicked.</p>
<p>The security module of the system guarantees proper accesses to radiology records. That is, a patient can only view his/her own records; a doctor can only view records of their patients; a radiologist can only review records conducted by oneself; and an administrator can view any records.</p> 
<p>User can modify the search condition and click the "<b>Search</b>" button to perform another search.</p>
